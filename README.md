This is a basic cinema booking simulator with a few simple functions. The user will be able to do/see the following:

- Upon running the program, a welcome message will be displayed along with a list of available films to book.
- The user will be required to type the name of a film from the list that they'd like to book tickets for.
- Once they have chosen a film, the program will verify wether they are old enough to see the film before proceeding with booking the tickets.
- Once verified, the user will be asked how many tickets they would like to book.
- When the tickets are booked, the program will display a sucess message and automatically terminate.
#
In any of the following cases, a programmed error message will be displayed and the program will restart:

- If there is a misspelling of the film name.
- If the film is not in the list (db).
- If the user is underage.
- If there aren't sufficient seats available.

The program will ONLY terminate once a booking has been sucessfully completed.

Take note that this is a very basic program that is meant to be viewed from a coding perspective as opposed to a UI/UE perspective.
The program was merely designed to showcase my abilities in the following:

- Python Programming; dictionaries, loops, lists, logical programming.
- Logical program structuring.
- Basic DB creation which could be translated to a basic SQL DB.
- Creating readable and collaborative-friendly code with sufficient notes that can be used by other programmers to understand the logic and reasoning of the code.
